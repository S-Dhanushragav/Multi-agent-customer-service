    "# Capstone Project: Intelligent Customer Support Router\n",
    "### Track: Concierge Agents (Customer Service)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview**\n",
    "This project implements a **Hierarchical Multi-Agent System** using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on rigid keyword matching (e.g., `if \"refund\" in text`), this system uses a semantic **Router-Specialist architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technical Features:**\n",
    "1.  **Semantic Routing:** A Root Agent powered by `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` intelligently determines user intent and delegates tasks to the correct specialist.\n",
    "2.  **Functional Tools:** Sub-agents are equipped with Python-based tools (`Dict` return types) to perform logic and simulate database lookups.\n",
    "3.  **Observability:** Integrated `LoggingPlugin` provides real-time tracing of the agent's thought process, tool calls, and state transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "* **Root Agent:** Triage & Routing\n",
    "* **Billing Specialist:** Handles refunds & invoices (Equipped with `check_refund_status`)\n",
    "* **Tech Support:** Handles device troubleshooting (Equipped with `troubleshoot_device`)"
